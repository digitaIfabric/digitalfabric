-- Hahah
-- Password
-- You can meet me at Crew anytime today and I'll tell you the password.
-- Mate, I work until 8pm tonight
-- And I'm back at work at 8am tomorrow
-- I work 2 jobs, have no time and will still be there at 8pm
-- And I don't think my boyfriend would be too keen on me meeting for a date
-- Honestly I'm in shock you're making this as difficult as you are
-- Please just forward the password. I'm not trying to be rude, but this is a lil tiring
-- ?
-- JAN 3RD, 9:41PM
-- Thanks for the support of X. You guys are the originals.
-- ?
-- JAN 4TH, 9:10AM
-- Can I please have the password now?
-- Or are you going to keep mocking me
-- And making me feel like an idiot
-- JAN 4TH, 10:29AM
-- ??
-- ????
-- ??
-- Do i need to come in in person??
-- JAN 4TH, 2:07PM
-- HELLO?
-- Can you meet at Crew?
-- It's so out of the way, nearly 40 minute drive
-- Can u meet near mcgill
-- JAN 4TH, 4:20PM
-- Hello?
-- JAN 5TH, 8:09AM
-- Hello?
-- I can't believe you're doing this. You make me wait an hour for you in New York. I turn down 2 people for you. You promised you would reimburse me for my troubles but then you just try to mess me around even more later on.
--
-- Why are you doing this? What did I do to you?
-- JAN 5TH, 10:53AM
-- JAN 5TH, 12:11PM
-- Call me.
-- JAN 9TH, 2:33AM
-- Hey, I thought I'd give you a heads up
-- If you don't send the password to me I plan to publicly shame you
-- And then brings some friends to your work
-- 😆
-- 1
-- I don't want to, but I feel so disrespected and disgusted that you feel entitled to pressure me into a date with you
-- JAN 9TH, 9:33AM
-- I didn’t make you wait and it was only 40 minutes. I apologized and tried to help you the best I could. There was a reason I didn’t make it there on time and you don’t seem to care very much about me as a human being. Can you please treat me with a little more respect?
-- JAN 9TH, 11:18AM
-- I am one of your friends.
-- Trying to be.
-- JAN 9TH, 2:21PM
-- David, I was full of remorse that you got in a knife fight before you started this whole "meet me for a story" and "where's our second date going to be" business
-- You would've never treated a man like that, but because im female you felt entitled to do so?
-- Honestly I don't give a fuck about 50$, but now it's a matter of principle because I don't like to be made to feel lesser because of my sex. Do you understand what I'm saying?
-- Yeah, I understand what you’re saying. I never meant to make you feel that way. If I was you I would probably ask yourself why you chose to write the words “made to feel lessor because of my sex”. Those aren’t my words and were never my intentions. It was closer to the opposite. I even remember a time above where you might’ve laughed. I feel connected to you in some strange way and I did just want to talk. I don’t know anything about you. I am quite happy in my own relationship and I think you are overreacting. I guess I’ll let her be the judge of that. If you were a man, I would have behaved similarly, but I probably would’ve used different words, so you have a point. I appreciate your perspective. I guess I rubbed you the wrong way and maybe your sensitive about something else that I don’t understand. I truly am sorry, but I don’t feel I owe you anything after the way you treated me.
-- You remember a time I might've laughed?
-- Are you mentally ill?
-- This is what I mean, you say "I felt connected to you"
-- Fake laugh
-- Very fake.
-- It means nothing.
-- Now
-- That is so weird man. I rented a car, it cost me money, i rejected people coming to save your seat which you bailed on because you got beat up the night before. You said you'd refund me, but then you start acting weird and telling me I need to meet you for our "first date" to get my money.
--
-- You understand how strange that is right?
-- Please, I  encourage you to get your girlfriend to ready this. It's not normal.
-- I do try to be different. Stranger things have happened. I am very sorry you ever decided to message me. I wish we never met. Goodbye.
-- We haven't met...
-- Alright
-- Well I know where you work, both jobs.
-- And I will be posting this to the ride share group
-- And to my wall.
-- Just a heads up
-- I trust you and I hope you choose to be my friend instead. When you do post it, you should probably add the NYPD case number from the police report.
-- David, do you understand why you upset me though?
-- When someone offers to give you a lift
-- When you promise to reimburse someone
-- It is not acceptable to then pressure them into a date with you
-- Do you understand?
-- JAN 17TH, 8:44PM
-- I understand and I’m sorry. I didn’t force you to do anything, I just asked you a challenging question in a creative way.
-- I had a $100 Esso gift card for you and I don’t own a car anymore so I thought we could both help each other out, but I fucked it up.
-- Next time just treat a girl like you would a guy and I think you'll get a far better response.
--
-- Thank you for apologising though, this makes me feel much better.
--
-- I will drop by your work early Febuary.
--
-- Until then
-- MON 1:37PM
-- Hello,
--
-- I will be receiving an early day to leave work this week. Please confirm when you will be working at the cafe so I may schedule a visit to pick up either $50 in cash or a gift card.
--
-- Regards,
-- Elsa
-- TUE 10:33AM
-- Hello,
--
-- Please reply at your earliest convenience so that I may schedule accordingly.
--
-- Your cooperation is appreciated at this time.
--
-- Regards,
-- WED 6:24AM
-- WED 7:48AM
-- Perfect. I will be calling your work today.
--
--
-- David, my bruv. How are you? Sending you my love this valentines day in the year 2018.
--
-- Also, I saw a little post today on facebook about some incident. I just wanna say that I'm here if you want someone to talk to/with. ❤
